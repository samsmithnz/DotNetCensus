# Welcome to your first Electron DotNet Application

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your application
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your application.  The format of package.json is exactly the same as that of Nodeâ€™s modules, and the script specified by the main field is the startup script of your app, which will run the `main` process.  `Note:` If the main field is not present in package.json, Electron will attempt to load an index.js.
* `main.js` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your application.  The main.js should create windows and handle system events.
* `index.html` - this is the web page you want to show.
* `<%- name %>.cs` - this src file defines a C# PepperPlugin implementation that will be printed to the console by default.

## Get up and running straight away
* press `F5` to open a new window with your application loaded.
  * On Windows look for `Launch Windows` target
  * On Mac select the `Launch Mac` target
* run your command from the command terminal `npm start`.
  * (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `View:Toggle Integrated Terminal`
  * Use the (`Ctrl+'` or `Cmd+'` on Mac) keyboard shortcut with the backtick character.
  * Use the `View | Toggle Integrated Terminal` menu command.

## Debugging
* Requires `Node.js` and the `Chrome Debugger`.
  * Install the [Chrome Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) with `ext install debugger-for-chrome`
