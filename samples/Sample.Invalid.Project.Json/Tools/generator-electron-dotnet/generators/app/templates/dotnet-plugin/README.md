# <%= name %> README

<%= description %>

This is the README for your application "<%= name %>". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Describe specific features of your application including screenshots of your application in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your application project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular applications utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your application! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your application.

## Release Notes
